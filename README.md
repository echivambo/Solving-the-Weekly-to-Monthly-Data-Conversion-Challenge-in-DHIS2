# Solving the Weekly to Monthly Data Conversion Challenge in DHIS2

In my work with health information systems, particularly DHIS2, I've encountered a common challenge: converting weekly data to monthly for analysis. This is especially important when integrating data from DHIS2 into tools like Power BI, where accurate period conversion is crucial.

## The Problem

While importing data from DHIS2 into Power BI via API, I faced a significant issue. Our programmatic team needed to analyze data both weekly and monthly, but the alignment of weeks and months didn't always match. Some months start mid-week, leading to potential discrepancies in data representation.

## My Approach

To tackle this, I dove into the DHIS2 documentation, but couldn’t find a straightforward solution. Instead of getting stuck, I leveraged my experience in data analysis and decided to test the data using Python and Excel. Through these tests, I uncovered how DHIS2 handles this conversion: if the number of days remaining in the first month is 4 or more, the data is assigned to that month; otherwise, it rolls over to the next.

## Why This Matters

This solution not only resolved the immediate challenge but also reinforced the importance of creativity and problem-solving in data management. It’s a reminder that sometimes the best solutions come from hands-on experimentation and deep technical knowledge.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis Expertise**: My experience allowed me to quickly identify and resolve a complex issue.
- **Creativity in Problem-Solving**: By stepping outside the documentation and testing with Python and Excel, I found an effective solution.
- **Proficiency with DHIS2 and Power BI**: My ability to integrate these tools effectively ensured that our data analysis processes remained accurate and reliable.

## Conclusion

This experience highlights the importance of adaptability and technical proficiency in managing health information systems. If you’re dealing with similar challenges in DHIS2 or need insights on integrating data with Power BI, I’d be happy to connect and share my approach.
